# ToDoListApp
Simple, but handy to do list desktop application. User can input task description and desired date for the task. Tasks will be sorted automatically by date and user can select option for viewing all, todays, coming or past tasks. No SQL-database was used to store user's inputs but tasks are stored in .ser file. GUI was created with WindowBuilder.

To use this app, just clone the repository and make runnable jar-file.
